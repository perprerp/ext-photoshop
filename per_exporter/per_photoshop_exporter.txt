Usage
  In Photoshop, tag a top-layer, visible, group with a format ("TGA")
  From File->Scripts->Browse pick a .jsx file.
  Action-record the previous step to allow for a keyboard shortcut.
  After some brief flickering all groups with tags are exported.
  Exported group layers will be expanded in the layer manager.
  Some of the scripts require editing to specify path parameters.
  Paths must be in URI format. "c/my_game/assets/textures".

Export to Tree
  Requires the root folder locations of source and destination.
  Will reconstruct the relative path leading to the source file.
  Example
    Source root is given as "c/my_wips"
    Destination root is given as "n/projects/our_game"
    Artist PSD path is "c/my_wips/assets/shoes/crocks.psd"
    Output files will be "n/projects/our_game/assets/shoes/crocks_*.*"

[R/G/B/A/RG/RB/GB]
    The following layers...
        "diffuse [TIFF]"
        "diffuse [A]"
        "diffuse [G]"
    ... combine into one output map as they're named the same (sans tags)
    Alpha channel is sourced from the red channel.
